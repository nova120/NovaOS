# This is a hub for NovaOS.
It doesn't host the versions, just brings you to them. It will host the wiki

# Pre-Snowcone & Max
These are all availible on Scratch. 

Sprinkle (1.1) https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/839766447/

Snow (2.0.2) https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/984982846/

Saturn (3.2) https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1019870065/

SM (4.0.1) https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1029229130/

Will provide files upon request.

# Snoecone
It has it's own github repository.

I feel like the thing that pulls the updates will get confused if Max and Snowcone were on the same repositoy.

You can find Snowcone here. https://github.com/nova120/NovaOS-Snowcone.git
